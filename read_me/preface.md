# Preface
## What is LIT?:

LIT stands for _Lit Ithkuilic Typing_.

It draws inspiration from many conlangs, but in particular John Quijada's ["A Grammar of Ithkuil"](http://www.ithkuil.net)

Basically, it is an Ithkuilic [conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language_) that is supposed to be easier to use than [Ithkuil](http://www.ithkuil.net/00_intro.html) and one that explicitly marks [semantic classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_class). This is similar to how programming languages use [type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) or how natural languages like Mandarin use [noun classifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifier_(linguistics) ) or like how Swahili uses [noun classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_class).

In general, most of Ithkuil's goals of representing a large breadth and precision of semantic ideas is preserved, but how LIT does that is somewhat different. The morphology is different. While concision is desirable, it does not take as much priority over ease of use and accuracy of communication.
LIT, in a way, is more similar to Ithkuil's predecessor [Ilkash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithkuil#Ilaksh_(2007)), which also used a kind of semantic class system.


For formally modeling the semantics, the grammar of this language is going to be represented through a [mixture of text and Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/Literate_programming).
In the future, maybe there will be a version implemented in a more rich and mature, [dependently typed](https://medium.com/background-thread/the-future-of-programming-is-dependent-types-programming-word-of-the-day-fcd5f263487) programming language like [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/tutorial-nahas).

Here are a few motivations for this:
- It's cool
- Easier to build an IDE or assistant to help communicating in LIT ( _a lit assistant_ )
- Formally clear representation of semantics
- Neat exploration for [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_semantics)
- There can be some insights into [Knowledge Representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning)
- Formal, computational approaches to the [humanities and general inquiry](https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2016/10/computational-law-symbolic-discourse-and-the-ai-constitution/)
- Easier to leverage [mathematical category-theoretic analysis](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/category-theory/)

## What Now?
Currently LIT is in alpha. I've been working on it for over a year.
However, it has been slowly growing in popularity and interest. So I am trying to publicize it more and get this LIT project more organized.

I plan to add in more and better documentation in the near future. My hope is to be able to express enough of the general idea of where the language is currently at so that more people may collaborate on developing the language and help determine what the language turns out to be.

This won't be an easy task and I expect, to be done on a larger, serious scale, would involve people from many different perspectives and backgrounds...

I guess, in a way, this is an early stage of what could be a more powerful language.
