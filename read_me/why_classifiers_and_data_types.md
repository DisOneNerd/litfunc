# Data Types/Semantic Classes
On one hand, someone could interpret requiring semantic categories or which semantic categories to encode as creating bias or restriction within the language. This is true and would likely be true in all design choices - with or without data types.

Data types are useful in that they help provide a way to represent the semantic of the language in a formal, neat way. Further, a guiding principle of LITs design is to help make communication in Ithkuilic  langs easier. So, in Ithkuil there are many basic consonantal roots that inflect similarly to encode similar information. That's basically what's happening in LIT, but it's made more clear.

More linguistically, they can be thought of as kind of like noun or verb classifiers that are prefixes on the main roots they interact with. So, for example, the difference between the English word "beef" vs "cow" would just be a difference of prefixes in LIT. One prefix would mark food while another would mark mammals more generally.

Consider the following ideas expressed in English:
- the number four
- a square
- a cube/block

These could all be represented in the language with the same basic root word and morphemes, but could be differentiated using alternate prefixes ( semantic classifiers )

For another example:
- A conversation w/ a speaker and audience
- Babbling, oral audiation ( emphasis on the physical act )
- Oral audiation, uttering ( emphasis on the noise )
- Spoken word, oral expression ( emphasis on meaning-making )

Each of these could be expressed in many ways, but at least four of them could be described using different prefixes as they may be classified in different semantic ways.

Or another example,
- An apple tree
- Apple juice
- Apple sauce
- Apple pie

For a final example, consider the following:
- Red light ( an electromagnetic wave/phenomenom )
- The color red ( a subjective, qualitative experience )
- Redness ( Emotions culturally associated w/ Red )
- To be red ( the physical act of being red due to some change in physiological state )
- To wear lots of red ( To cover one's self entirely in red clothing and coloring )
- a red rock ( like a garnet or a ruby - one generally may specify as desired )

Again, each of these could use different prefixes to concisely, clearly convey different ideas.

One might argue that the above examples are presented to broadly or coarsely.
Language is more complicated than simple, broad classifiers or categories.
Things intersect and may overlap in different categories.

This is true. LIT has several ways of handling this.
For one, there are ways to "nest" categories or kind of dependently type them.

For example, the "spoken word, oral expression" could be conveyed in a way that simultaneously reflects the meaning of spoken word in a conversation. One could even go further and encode the context of the conversation all in a single word. Consequently, through the usage of different morphemes, one could create a word that might roughly translate to "the meanings of words one would say when they are engaged in a heated argument" or potentially a word for "the texture of rocks that are red."

In addition to typing, LIT expresses what Ithkuil encodes as noun cases into particles that link words together in highly precise ways. Using these, one might be able to more concisely encode phrases like:
- A box made of rocks
- A box that contains rocks
- A box whose intended purpose is to contain rocks
- A box that has the shape of a rock
- A box located near a pile of rocks
- A box on top of a pile of rocks

To aide in concision and range of expression, the semantic classifying prefixes generally take a vowel affix to further articulate how a basic root word or consonantal root may relate to the semantic category. Accordingly, the following words may use the same semantic category prefix AND the same root word, but they may take a different vowel infix or reflect some other, single morphological change:
- A conversation
- A speaker
- An audience
- To listen
- To speak
- To converse

Or another example:
- A tool whose intended purpose is to hammer nails ( a hammer, a mallet, etc )
- A tool being used to hammer nails ( maybe a club or a sturdy book or a wrench )
- A tool that resembles a hammer
- A tool often associated or paired with a hammer

Or another example:
- A calf
- A female cow
- A young bull
